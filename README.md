## Acknowledgments

The initial file and directory structure of this project was developed by a group of participants in the Reproducible Science Curriculum Workshop, held at [NESCent] in December 2014. The structure is based on, and heavily follows the one proposed by [Noble 2009], with a few but small modifications. The [original repository] has been [modified] by Martin Engqvist and the one presented here differs in some ways.
